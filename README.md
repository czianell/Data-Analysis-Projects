# DataAnalysisProjects
Data analysis projects demonstrating SQL, Python, and Tableau knowledge.

Each project focuses on different datasets and goals. I conducted data analysis through SQL (data exploration), Tableau (data exploration & visualization), and/or Python (data cleansing/scraping/analysis).
